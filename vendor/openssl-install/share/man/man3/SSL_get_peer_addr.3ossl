.SH NAME
SSL_get_peer_addr \- obtain the peer address of a QUIC connection
.SH SYNOPSIS
.IX Header "SYNOPSIS"
.Vb 1
\& #include <openssl/ssl.h>
\&
\& int SSL_get_peer_addr(SSL *ssl, BIO_ADDR *peer_addr);
.Ve
.SH DESCRIPTION
.IX Header "DESCRIPTION"
\&\fBSSL_get_peer_addr()\fR retrieves the peer address of a QUIC connection and stores
it into the \fBBIO_ADDR\fR structure pointed to by \fIpeer_addr\fR. The caller must
supply a valid \fBBIO_ADDR\fR object which will be filled in on success.
.PP
This function is only meaningful when called on an SSL object which represents
a QUIC connection or stream. It is not valid for non-QUIC SSL objects.
.SH NOTES
.IX Header "NOTES"
The peer address identifies the remote endpoint of a QUIC connection. For UDP
sockets used by QUIC, the kernel does not maintain a connected peer in the same
sense as for TCP. Instead, the peer address is tracked in the QUIC connection
state. \fBSSL_get_peer_addr()\fR provides a way to obtain this address information
from OpenSSL.
.PP
The \fBBIO_ADDR\fR type is an OpenSSL abstraction which can represent
both IPv4 and IPv6 socket addresses. Applications can get the address
family via the \fBBIO_ADDR\fR\|(3) API.
.SH "RETURN VALUES"
.IX Header "RETURN VALUES"
\&\fBSSL_get_peer_addr()\fR returns 1 on success. On failure, or if called on an SSL
object which is not a QUIC SSL object, 0 is returned and \fIpeer_addr\fR is left
unchanged.
